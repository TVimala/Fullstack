            </h4>
            <p>You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo, where there's demand there will be supply, wee'll all have our roads.

            <p>If I came to your home with some heavily armed budddies, demanding that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of you income, in return for some crappy monopolised services that you did'nt ask for, would you consider that theft?

            <p>A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.</p>
